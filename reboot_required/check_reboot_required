On debian based systems, the existance of /var/run/reboot-required
(and /var/run/reboot-required.pkgs) lets the user know that the system
needs to be rebooted. The .pkgs file tells why.

This plugin looks for /var/run/reboot-required and returns a warning
if it's found. Otherwise it returns ok.

Example:

    ./check_reboot_required
"""


import sys
import os
from optparse import OptionParser


prefix = 'check_reboot_required'

class nagios:
    ok       = (0, 'OK')
    warning  = (1, 'WARNING')
    critical = (2, 'CRITICAL')
    unknown  = (3, 'UNKNOWN')


def exit(status, message):
    print prefix + ' ' + status[1] + ' - ' + message
    sys.exit(status[0])

reboot_required_path = '/var/run/reboot-required'

if os.path.exists(reboot_required_path):
    exit(nagios.warning, 'reboot required')

else:
    exit(nagios.ok, 'no reboot required')
